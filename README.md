# Sending pictures from a Xojo app to HTMLViewer via Javascript

A simple project that demonstrates creating/getting a bitmap (either generated procedurally in Xojo: new Picture → get graphics context → set colours and draw etc, or loaded from filesystem: select file → FolderItem → Picture open) and then encoding it base64 and sending and displaying it via Javascript to a web page loaded in an HTMLViewer.
